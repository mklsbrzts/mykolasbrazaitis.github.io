<strong>Post-rock</strong> is a subgenre of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music">Rock music</a> characterized by the 
influence and use of instruments commonly associated with rock, but using rhythms and <mark>"guitars as facilitators of timbre
 and textures"</mark> not traditionally found in rock. <strong>Post-rock</strong> bands are often <mark> without vocals.</mark>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogwai">Mogwai</a>, Slint, Don Caballero and Tortoise are among the more prominent
 bands described as <strong>Post-rock</strong>, but their styles are very different, despite being instrumental bands centered on guitars
  and drums. <del>As such, the term has been the subject of backlash from listeners and artists alike.</del> 
<mark>Although firmly rooted in the indie or underground scene of the 1980s</mark>,
 <strong>Post-rock</strong>'s style often bears little resemblance musically to that of contemporary <a href="">indie rock</a>
 Post-rock appears to take a heavy influence from late 1960s U.S. group The Velvet Underground and their "dronology" — "a term that loosely
 describes fifty percent of today's post rock activity".[11] A 2004 article from Stylus Magazine noted that David Bowie's album Low (1977) 
 would have been considered post-rock if released twenty years later. British group Public Image Ltd (PiL) were also pioneers, described by
 the NME as "arguably the first post-rock group". Their second album Metal Box (1979) almost completely abandoned traditional rock and roll
 structures in favor of dense, repetitive dub and krautrock inspired soundscapes and John Lydon's cryptic, stream-of-consciousness lyrics. 
 The year before Metal Box was released, PiL bassist Jah Wobble declared, "rock is obsolete".[14] The Flowers of Romance (1981), 
 their third album, was an even more radical departure, emphasizing rattling percussion and abstract tape music.

<h2>Origin of the term</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">

<p><mark">The term "post-rock" is believed to have been coined by critic Simon Reynolds</mark>
 in his review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, published in the March 1994 issue of Mojo magazine.[6] Reynolds expanded upon the
  idea later in the May 1994 issue of The Wire.</p>

<ins>Reynolds, in a July 2005 entry in his blog, claimed </ins> he had used the term "post-rock" before using it in Mojo, 
previously using it in music newspaper Melody Maker.[8] <ins>He also said he later found the term not to be of his own creation</ins>,
 saying in his blog, <code>"although I genuinely believed I was coining the term, I discovered many years later it had been 
 floating around for over a decade." </code>The term was used by American journalist James Wolcott in a 1975 article about
 musician Todd Rundgren, although with a different meaning.<del>It was also used in the Rolling Stone Album Guide to name 
 a style roughly corresponding to "avant-rock" or "out-rock".</del>
 Bands from the early 1990s, such as Slint or, earlier, Talk Talk, were later recognized as influential on post-rock.[3] 
 Despite the fact that the two bands are highly different from one another, Talk Talk emerging from art rock and new wave
 and Slint emerging from post-hardcore, they both have had a driving influence on the way post-rock progressed throughout
 the 1990s. Originally used to describe the music of English bands such as Stereolab,[15] Laika,[16] Disco Inferno,[17] 
 Moonshake,[18] Seefeel,[3] Bark Psychosis, and Pram,[2] post-rock grew to be frequently used for a variety of jazz and
 krautrock influenced, largely instrumental, and electronica-tinged music made after 1994. Groups such as Cul de Sac, 
 Tortoise, Labradford, Bowery Electric and Stars of the Lid are cited as founders of a distinctly American post-rock
 movement.[19] The second Tortoise LP Millions Now Living Will Never Die, made the band a post-rock icon.[3][20] Many
 bands (e.g., Do Make Say Think) began to record music inspired by the "Tortoise-sound". In the late 1990s, Chicago was
 the home base for a variety of post-rock associated performers. Both John McEntire of Tortoise and Jim O'Rourke of
 Brise-Glace and Gastr del Sol were important producers for many of the groups.[22] One of the most eminent post-rock
 locales is Montreal, where Godspeed You! Black Emperor and similar groups, including Silver Mt. Zion and Fly Pan Am 
 record on Constellation Records, a notable post-rock record label.[23] These groups are generally characterized by an
 aesthetic rooted in, among other genres, musique concrète, chamber music, and free jazz.

<h2>Musical characteristics</h2>

The post-rock sound incorporates characteristics from a variety of musical genres, including post-punk, progressive rock,
 space rock, ambient, dub, electronica, and experimental, as well as various forms of jazz such as cool jazz, avant-garde 
 jazz and free jazz.[4][32] Early post-rock groups also often exhibited strong influence from the krautrock of the '70s,
 particularly borrowing elements of "motorik", the characteristic krautrock rhythm. Post-rock compositions often make use
 of repetition of musical motifs and subtle changes with an extremely wide range of dynamics. In some respects, this is 
 similar to the music of Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Brian Eno, pioneers of minimalism.[24] Typically, post-rock pieces
 are lengthy and instrumental, containing repetitive build-ups of timbre, dynamics and texture.[2] Vocals are often
 omitted from post-rock; however, this does not necessarily mean they are absent entirely. When vocals are included,
 the use is typically non-traditional: some post-rock bands employ vocals as purely instrumental efforts and incidental
 to the sound, rather than a more traditional use where "clean", easily interpretable vocals are important for poetic and
 lyrical meaning.[4] When present, post-rock vocals are often soft or droning and are typically infrequent or present in
 irregular intervals. Sigur Rós, a band known for their distinctive vocals, fabricated a language that critics call 
 "Hopelandic" ("Vonlenska" in Icelandic, a term even used by the band), which has been described by the band as "a form 
 of gibberish vocals that fits to the music and acts as another instrument." In lieu of typical rock structures like the
 verse-chorus form, post-rock groups generally make greater use of soundscapes. As Simon Reynolds states in his
 "Post-Rock" from Audio Culture, "A band's journey through rock to post-rock usually involves a trajectory from narrative
 lyrics to stream-of-consciousness to voice-as-texture to purely instrumental music".[36] Reynolds' conclusion defines
 the sporadic progression from rock, with its field of sound and lyrics to post-rock, where samples are stretched and
 looped. Wider experimentation and blending of other genres have recently taken hold in the post-rock scene. Cult of Luna,
 Isis, Russian Circles, Palms, Deftones, and Pelican have fused metal with post-rock styles. The resulting sound has
 been termed post-metal. More recently, sludge metal has grown and evolved to include (and in some cases fuse completely
 with) some elements of post-rock. This second wave of sludge metal has been pioneered by bands such as Giant Squid and
 Battle of Mice. This new sound is often seen on the label of Neurot Recordings.[37] Similarly, bands such as Altar of
 Plagues, Lantlôs and Agalloch blend between post-rock and black metal, incorporating elements of the former while
 primarily using the latter.[38] In some cases, this sort of experimentation and blending has gone beyond the fusion
 of post-rock with a single genre, as in the case of post-metal, in favor of an even wider embrace of disparate musical
 influences as it can be heard in bands like Deafheaven.
